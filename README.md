# HMMTrainer
HMMTrainer is a C++ based Hidden Markov Model library. The library currently supports training multinomial HMMs and evaluating symbol sequences using multinomial HMMs, as well as generating embedding vectors for symbol sequences using the emission probability matrix of HMMs trained on sequences. 
## Features
* Accelerated HMM Training and Evaluation using Multi-threading and SIMD intrinsics
* Support for generating HMM embedding vectors
* Multinomial HMM Training
* Support for training on multiple sequences of varying lengths
